        Instructions :

        <li>
            In a large bowl, soak the chicken pieces in buttermilk for at least 30 minutes.

        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and place a baking sheet in the oven while it preheats.

            Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing any excess to drip off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour mixture, ensuring they are well coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and lightly coat it with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the coated chicken pieces on the baking sheet, skin-side up.
